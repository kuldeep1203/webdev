//useeffect has a function to run and a dependency array =-+-*-+//sum-server.100xdevs.com/todos

//Some components need to synchronize with external systems.
// For example, you might want to control a non-React component 
//based on the React state, set up a server connection, or send an analytics log when a component appears on the screen. 
//Effects let you run some code after rendering so that you can synchronize your component with some system outside of React.
//sideeffects  - stuff not related to dom such as fetching data andstuff 
//these things arent part of main react lifecycle
//access react lifecycle features without writing classes (such as component has mounted or unmounted);

//use effect allows to perform sideeffects in fucntion componenets 
//-these componenets cannot be done during rendering 
//it is a replacement to componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount etc..
//like a pitstop in f1..
//hooks allow u to hook into thereact state and lifecylce features from fucntion components

suppose u want to fetch data from aserver now u dont want to do this everytime the app is rerendered
due to state change so usign useeffect we can make sure that the fetch call is only done 
under some conditions , which is return in the dependency array 

//useMemo 
it means remembering some output given an input and nto relcalculatingit when same input is given to

usecallback 
used to memoize functions which can help to optimize the performace of your application 


if u define any variable like var a =1 ;
var b == 1
and a==b be true

they are ony equal by value and not by reference

so when does react actually rerender ?? - when it changes referentially it rerenders

use callback  : prevenets reredner of fucntions,across rereneders fucntion changes referentially  so if no dependency of the function change it will not get rerendered


memo - if u wrap a child inside it then child will only rerender if the inputs specific to tthe child has changed and it wont rerender everyitme the parent is rerendered

CUSTOM HOOKS - shld strt with use (naming convention)

--u cant create a raw fucntion and use hooks in it u need to define custome hooks or naother hook to use a hook logic to create
hence the custome hooks and


//state  - is the dynamic things on ur site which change
